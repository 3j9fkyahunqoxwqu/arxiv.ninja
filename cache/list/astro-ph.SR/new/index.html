<p class="mathjax">Young double star V1318 Cyg, which is associated with a small isolated
star-forming region around HAeBe star BD+40o4124, has very unusual photometric
and spectral behavior. We present results of photometric and spectroscopic
observations in the optical range. We carried out BVRI CCD photometric
observations of V1318 Cyg from 2015 Sept. to 2017 July. For the same period we
acquired medium- and low-resolution spectra. Observations were performed with
the 2.6 m telescope. We analyze the historical light curve for V1318 Cyg and
demonstrate that the southern component, V1318 Cyg S, after being rather bright
in the 1970s (V$\approx$14 mag) started to lower its brightness and in 1990
became practically invisible in the optical. After its reappearance in the
second half of the 1990s the star started to become very slowly brighter.
Between 2006 and 2010 V1318 Cyg S started brightening more quickly, and in 2015
had become brighter by more than five magnitudes in visible light. Since this
time V1318 Cyg S has remained at this maximum. Its spectrum shows little
variability and consists of a mixture of emission and absorption lines, which
has allowed for estimates of its spectral type as early Ae, with obvious
evidence of matter outflow. We derive its current A(V)$\approx$ 7.2 and L = 750
L(sun) thus confirming that V1318 Cyg S should belong to the Herbig Ae stars,
making it, along with BD+40o4124 and V1686 Cyg, the third luminous young star
in the group. It is very probable that we observe V1318 Cyg S near the pole and
that the inclination of its dense and slow ($\approx$ 100 km/s) outflow is low.
The unusual variability and other features of V1318 Cyg S make it difficult to
classify this star among known types of eruptive young stars. It could be an
extreme, higher-mass example of an EXor, or an object of intermediate class
between EXors and FUors, like V1647 Ori.

<p class="mathjax">EUV waves are large-scale disturbances in the solar corona initiated by
coronal mass ejections. However, solar EUV images show only the wave fronts
projections along the line-of-sight of the spacecraft. We perform 3D
reconstructions of EUV wave front heights using multi-point observations from
STEREO-A and STEREO-B, and study their evolution to properly estimate the EUV
wave kinematics. We develop two different methods to solve the matching problem
of the EUV wave crest on pairs of STEREO-A/-B images by combining epipolar
geometry with the investigation of perturbation profiles. The proposed
approaches are applicable at the early and maximum stage of the event when
STEREO-A/-B see different facets of the EUV wave, but also at the later stage
when the wave front becomes diffusive and faint. The techniques developed are
demonstrated on two events observed at different separation of the STEREO
spacecraft (42$^\circ$ and 91$^\circ$). For the 7 December 2007 event, we find
that the emission of the EUV wave front mainly comes from a height range up to
90-104 Mm, decreasing later to 7-35 Mm. Including the varying height of the EUV
wave front allows us to correct the wave kinematics for the projection effects,
resulting in velocities in the range 217-266 km/s. For the 13 February 2009
event, the wave front height doubled from 54 to 93 Mm over 10 min, and the
velocity derived is 205-208 km/s. In the two events under study, the corrected
speeds differ by up to 25% from the uncorrected ones, depending on the wave
front height evolution.

<p class="mathjax">Context: The chromospheric anemone microflares (AMF) are an interesting kind
of the transient solar phenomena where the emission regions have a multi-ribbon
configuration, as distinct from the ordinary flares usually possessing only two
ribbons. The previously reported AMFs had typically three or, less frequently,
four ribbons; and it was shown in our recent Letter [Yu.V. Dumin &amp; B.V. Somov,
A&amp;A, 623, L4 (2019)] that they can be reasonably described by the so-called
GKSS model of magnetic field, involving four magnetic sources with various
polarity and arrangement. Aims: An interesting question is if one can see more
complex types of AMF (containing the grater number of the emission ribbons),
which might be produced by more elaborated magnetic configurations? Methods: To
answer this question, we performed a visual inspection of the large set of the
emission patterns in the chromospheric line CaII H recorded by Hinode/SOT and
confronted them with the respective magnetograms obtained by SDO/HMI. Results:
As follows from our analysis, it is really possible to identify the AMFs with
much more complex spatial configurations as compared to the previously-known
ones, e.g., involving five luminous ribbons with a nontrivial arrangement. They
are produced by the effective magnetic sources (sunspots) of different polarity
with intermittent arrangement in the cross-like configuration, but their number
is greater than in the standard GKSS model.

<p class="mathjax">There are now $\sim$20 multi-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN)
simulations that explode. However, these simulations have explosion energies
that are a few times $10^{50}$ erg, not $10^{51}$ erg. In this manuscript, we
compare the inferred explosion energies of these simulations and observations
of 38 SN~IIP. Assuming a log-normal distribution, the mean explosion energy for
the observations is $\mu_{\rm obs} = -0.13\pm 0.05$ ($\log_{10}(E/10^{51}\,
{\rm erg})$) and the width is $\sigma_{\rm obs} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. Only
three CCSN codes have sufficient simulations to compare with observations:
CHIMERA, CoCoNuT-FMT, and FORNAX. Currently, FORNAX has the largest sample of
simulations. The two-dimensional FORNAX simulations show a correlation between
explosion energy and progenitor mass, ranging from linear to quadratic, $E_{\rm
sim} \propto M^{1-2}$; this correlation is consistent with inferences from
observations. In addition, we infer the ratio of the observed-to-simulated
explosion energies, $\Delta=\log_{10}(E_{\rm obs}/E_{\rm sim})$. For the
CHIMERA set, $\Delta=0.33\pm0.06$; for CoCoNuT-FMT, $\Delta=0.62\pm0.05$; for
FORNAX2D, $\Delta=0.73\pm0.05$, and for FORNAX3D, $\Delta=0.95\pm0.06$. On
average, the simulations are less energetic than inferred energies from
observations ($\Delta \approx 0.7$), but we also note that the variation among
the simulations (max($\Delta$)-min($\Delta$) $\approx 0.6$) is as large as this
average offset. This suggests that further improvements to the simulations
could resolve the discrepancy. Furthermore, both the simulations and the
observations are heavily biased. In this preliminary comparison, we model these
biases, but to more reliably compare the explosion energies, we recommend
strategies to un-bias both the simulations and observations.

<p class="mathjax">The solar radiation focusing effect is related to the specific phenomenon of
propagation of the Sun-emitted HF and VHF waves through terrestrial ionosphere.
This natural effect is observed with ground-based radio instruments running
within 10-200 MHz range, as distinctive patterns - the Spectral Caustics (SCs)
- on the solar dynamic spectra. It has been suggested that SCs are associated
with medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs). In this paper,
we present the first direct observations of SCs induced by MSTIDs, using solar
dynamic spectra with SCs obtained by different European radio telescopes on
January 8, 2014 and simultaneous two-dimensional detrended total electron
content (dTEC) maps over Europe. Spatial examination of dTEC maps as well as
precise timing analysis of the maps and the dynamic spectra have been
performed. First, we found several pairs of one-to-one (TID-SC)
correspondences. The study provides strong observational evidence supporting
the suggestion that MSTIDs are the cause of SCs.

<p class="mathjax">The determination of the magnetic filed vector in solar filaments is possible
by interpreting the Hanle and Zeeman effects in suitable chromospheric spectral
lines like those of the He I multiplet at 10830 A. We study the vector magnetic
field of an active region filament (NOAA 12087). Spectropolarimetric data of
this active region was acquired with the GRIS instrument at the GREGOR
telescope and studied simultaneously in the chromosphere with the He I 10830 A
multiplet and in the photosphere with the Si I 10827 A line. As it is usual
from previous studies, only a single component model is used to infer the
magnetic properties of the filament. The results are put into a solar context
with the help of the Solar Dynamic Observatory images. Some results clearly
point out that a more complex inversion had to be done. Firstly, the Stokes $V$
map of He I does not show any clear signature of the presence of the filament.
Secondly, the local azimuth map follows the same pattern than Stokes $V$ as if
the polarity of Stokes $V$ were conditioning the inference to very different
magnetic field even with similar linear polarization signals. This indication
suggests that the Stokes $V$ could be dominated by the below magnetic field
coming from the active region, and not, from the filament itself. Those and
more evidences will be analyzed in depth and a more complex inversion will be
attempted in the second part of this series.

<p class="mathjax">Solar CMEs and flares have a statistically well defined relation, with more
energetic X-ray flares corresponding to faster and more massive CMEs. How this
relation extends to more magnetically active stars is a subject of open
research. Here, we study the most probable stellar CME candidates associated
with flares captured in the literature to date, all of which were observed on
magnetically active stars. We use a simple CME model to derive masses and
kinetic energies from observed quantities, and transform associated flare data
to the GOES 1--8~\AA\ band. Derived CME masses range from $\sim 10^{15}$ to
$10^{22}$~g. Associated flare X-ray energies range from $10^{31}$ to
$10^{37}$~erg. Stellar CME masses as a function of associated flare energy
generally lie along or below the extrapolated mean for solar events. In
contrast, CME kinetic energies lie below the analogous solar extrapolation by
roughly two orders of magnitude, indicating approximate parity between flare
X-ray and CME kinetic energies. These results suggest that the CMEs associated
with very energetic flares on active stars are more limited in terms of the
ejecta velocity than the ejecta mass, possibly because of the restraining
influence of strong overlying magnetic fields and stellar wind drag. Lower CME
kinetic energies and velocities present a more optimistic scenario for the
effects of CME impacts on exoplanets in close proximity to active stellar
hosts.

<p class="mathjax">We investigate the abundance of $^{19}F$ in the Sun through the
nucleosynthesis scenario. In addition, we calculate the rate equations and
reaction rates of the nucleosynthesis of $^{19}F$ at different temperature
scale. Other important functions of this nucleosynthesis (nuclear partition
function and statistical equilibrium conditions) are also obtained. The
resulting stability of $^{19}F$ occurs at nucleus with A = 19 and Mass Excess=
-1.4874 MeV. As a result, this will tend to a series of neutron captures and
beta-decay until $^{19}F$ is produced. The reaction rate of $^{15}N$ ($\alpha$,
$\gamma$) $^{19}F$ was dominated by the contribution of three low-energy
resonances, which enhanced the final $^{19}F$ abundance in the envelope.

<p class="mathjax">Binary-single interactions play a crucial role in the evolution of dense
stellar systems such as globular clusters. In addition, they are believed to
drive black hole (BH) binary mergers in these systems. A subset of
binary-single interactions are secular encounters, for which the third body
approaches the binary on a relatively wide orbit, and such that it is justified
to average the equations of motion over the binary's orbital phase. Previous
works used first-order perturbation theory to compute the effects of such
secular encounters on the binary. However, this approach can break down for
highly eccentric binaries, which are important for BH binary mergers and
gravitational wave sources. Here, we present an analytic computation using
second-order perturbation techniques, valid to the quadrupole-order
approximation. In our calculation, we take into account the instantaneous
back-reaction of the binary to the third body, and compute corrections to
previous first-order results. Using singly-averaged and direct 3-body
integrations, we demonstrate the validity of our expressions. In particular, we
show that the eccentricity change for highly eccentric binaries can reach a
plateau, associated with a large inclination change, and can even reverse sign.
These effects are not captured by previous first-order results. We provide a
simple script to conveniently evaluate our analytic expressions, including
routines for numerical integration and verification.

<p class="mathjax">The electromagnetic interaction alters the Chandrasekhar mass limit by a
factor which depends, as computed in the literature, on the atomic number of
the positively charged nuclei present within the degenerate matter.
Unfortunately, the methods employed for such computations break Lorentz
invariance ab initio. By employing the methods of finite temperature
relativistic quantum field theory, we show that in the leading order, the
effect of electromagnetic interaction reduces the Chandrasekhar mass limit for
non-general-relativistic, spherically symmetric white dwarfs by a universal
factor of $(1-3\alpha/4\pi)$, $\alpha$ being the fine-structure constant.

<p class="mathjax">Similar to the Sun, other stars shed mass and magnetic flux via ubiquitous
quasi-steady wind and episodic stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We
investigate the mass loss rate via solar wind and CMEs as a function of solar
magnetic variability represented in terms of sunspot number and solar X-ray
background luminosity. We estimate the contribution of CMEs to the total solar
wind mass flux in the ecliptic and beyond, and its variation over different
phases of the solar activity cycles. The study exploits the number of sunspots
observed, coronagraphic observations of CMEs near the Sun by SOHO/LASCO, in
situ observations of the solar wind at 1 AU by WIND, and GOES X-ray flux during
solar cycle 23 and 24. We note that the X-ray background luminosity, occurrence
rate of CMEs and ICMEs, solar wind mass flux, and associated mass loss rates
from the Sun do not decrease as strongly as the sunspot number from the maximum
of solar cycle 23 to the next maximum. Our study confirms a true physical
increase in CME activity relative to the sunspot number in cycle 24. We show
that the CME occurrence rate and associated mass loss rate can be better
predicted by X-ray background luminosity than the sunspot number. The solar
wind mass loss rate which is an order of magnitude more than the CME mass loss
rate shows no obvious dependency on cyclic variation in sunspot number and
solar X-ray background luminosity. These results have implications to the study
of solar-type stars.

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of magnetic flux rope (MFR) formation and
eruption driven by photospheric converging motion. The current sheet (CS)
evolution during the MFR formation and eruption process in our MHD simulation
can be divided into four stages. The current sheet (CS) evolution during the
MFR formation and eruption process in our MHD simulation can be divided into
four stages. The first stage shows the CS forming and gradually lengthening.
Resistive instabilities that disrupt the CS mark the beginning of the second
stage. Magnetic islands disappear in the third stage and reappear in the fourth
stage. Synthetic images and light curves of the seven Solar Dynamics
Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels, i.e., 9.4 nm, 13.1 nm,
17.1 nm, 19.3 nm, 21.1 nm, 30.4 nm, and 33.5 nm, and the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray
are obtained with forward-modeling analysis. The loop-top source and the
coronal sources of the soft X-ray are reproduced in forward modeling. The light
curves of the seven SDO/AIA channels start to rise once resistive instabilities
develop. The light curve of the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray starts to go up when the
reconnection rate reaches one of its peaks. Quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs)
appear twice in the SDO/AIA 17.1 nm, 21.1 nm, and 30.4 nm channels,
corresponding to the period of chaotic (re)appearance and CS-guided
displacements of the magnetic islands. QPPs appear once in the SDO/AIA 9.4 nm
and 33.5 nm channels after the disruption of the CS by resistive instabilities
and in the 19.3 nm channel when the chaotic motion of the magnetic islands
reappears.

<p class="mathjax">Line ratios for different transitions of the same molecule have long been
used as a probe of gas temperature. Here we use ALMA observations of the N2H+
J~=~1-0 and J~=~4-3 lines in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya to derive
the temperature at which these lines emit. We find an averaged temperature of
39~K with a one sigma uncertainty of 2~K for the radial range 0.8-2'',
significantly warmer than the expected midplane temperature beyond 0.5'' in
this disk. We conclude that the N2H+ emission in TW Hya is not emitting from
near the midplane, but rather from higher in the disk, in a region likely
bounded by processes such as photodissociation or chemical reprocessing of CO
and N2 rather than freeze out.

<p class="mathjax">Turbulence is commonly observed in nearly collisionless heliospheric plasmas,
including the solar wind and corona and the Earth's magnetosphere.
Understanding the collisionless mechanisms responsible for the energy transfer
from the turbulent fluctuations to the particles is a frontier in kinetic
turbulence research. Collisionless energy transfer from the turbulence to the
particles can take place reversibly, resulting in non-thermal energy in the
particle velocity distribution functions (VDFs) before eventual collsional
thermalization is realized. Exploiting the information contained in the
fluctuations in the VDFs is valuable. Here we apply a recently developed method
based on VDFs, the field-particle correlation technique, to a $\beta$ = 1,
solar-wind-like, low-frequency Alfv\'enic turbulence simulation with well
resolved phase space to identify the field-particle energy transfer in velocity
space. The field-particle correlations reveal that the energy transfer,
mediated by the parallel electric field, results in significant structuring of
the VDF in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Fourier modes
representing the length scales between the ion and electron gyroradii show that
energy transfer is resonant in nature, localized in velocity space to the
Landau resonances for each Fourier mode. The energy transfer closely follows
the Landau resonant velocities with varying length scales $k_\perp$ and plasma
$\beta$'s. This resonant signature, consistent with Landau damping, is observed
in all diagnosed Fourier modes that cover the dissipation range of the
simulation.

<p class="mathjax">A protoneutron star produced in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) drives a
wind by its intense neutrino emission. We implement active-sterile neutrino
oscillations in a steady-state model of this neutrino-driven wind to study
their effects on the dynamics and nucleosynthesis of the wind in a
self-consistent manner. Using vacuum mixing parameters indicated by some
experiments for a sterile $\nu_s$ of $\sim 1$~eV in mass, we observe
interesting features of oscillations due to various feedback. For the higher
$\nu_s$ mass values, we find that oscillations can reduce the mass loss rate
and the wind velocity by a factor of $\sim 1.6$--2.7 and change the electron
fraction critical to nucleosynthesis by a significant to large amount. In the
most dramatic cases, oscillations shifts nucleosynthesis from dominant
production of $^{45}$Sc to that of $^{86}$Kr and $^{90}$Zr during the early
epochs of the CCSN evolution.

<p class="mathjax">During the dawn of chemistry when the temperature of the young Universe had
fallen below $\sim$4000 K, the ions of the light elements produced in Big Bang
nucleosynthesis recombined in reverse order of their ionization potential. With
its higher ionization potentials, He$^{++}$ (54.5 eV) and He$^+$ (24.6 eV)
combined first with free electrons to form the first neutral atom, prior to the
recombination of hydrogen (13.6 eV). At that time, in this metal-free and
low-density environment, neutral helium atoms formed the Universe's first
molecular bond in the helium hydride ion HeH$^+$, by radiative association with
protons (He + H$^+$ $\rightarrow$ HeH$^+$ + h$\nu$). As recombination
progressed, the destruction of HeH$^+$ (HeH$^+$ + H $\rightarrow$ He + H$_2^+$)
created a first path to the formation of molecular hydrogen, marking the
beginning of the Molecular Age. Despite its unquestioned importance for the
evolution of the early Universe, the HeH$^+$ molecule has so far escaped
unequivocal detection in interstellar space. In the laboratory, the ion was
discovered as long ago as 1925, but only in the late seventies was the
possibility that HeH$^+$ might exist in local astrophysical plasmas discussed.
In particular, the conditions in planetary nebulae were shown to be suitable
for the production of potentially detectable HeH$^+$ column densities: the hard
radiation field from the central hot white dwarf creates overlapping
Str\"omgren spheres, where HeH$^+$ is predicted to form, primarily by radiative
association of He$^+$ and H. With the GREAT spectrometer onboard SOFIA, the
HeH$^+$ rotational ground-state transition at $\lambda$149.1 $\mu$m is now
accessible. We report here its detection towards the planetary nebula NGC7027.

<p class="mathjax">We present a mid-infrared (IR) sample study of nearby ultraluminous X-ray
sources (ULXs) using multi-epoch observations with the Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Spitzer/IRAC observations taken after
2014 were obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared Intensive Transients Survey
(SPIRITS). Our sample includes 96 ULXs located within 10 Mpc. Of the 96~ULXs,
12 have candidate counterparts consistent with absolute mid-IR magnitudes of
supergiants, and 16 counterparts exceeded the mid-IR brightness of single
supergiants and are thus more consistent with star clusters or non-ULX
background active galactic nuclei (AGN). The supergiant candidate counterparts
exhibit a bi-modal color distribution in a Spitzer/IRAC color-magnitude
diagram, where "red" and "blue" ULXs fall in IRAC colors $[3.6] - [4.5]\sim0.7$
and $[3.6] - [4.5]\sim0.0$, respectively. The mid-IR colors and absolute
magnitudes of 4 "red" and 5 "blue" ULXs are consistent with that of supergiant
B[e] (sgB[e]) and red supergiant (RSG) stars, respectively. While "blue",
RSG-like mid-IR ULX counterparts likely host RSG mass donors, we propose the
"red" counterparts are ULXs exhibiting the "B[e] phenomenon'' rather than hosts
of sgB[e] mass donors. We show that the mid-IR excess from the "red" ULXs is
likely due to thermal emission from circumstellar or circumbinary dust. Using
dust as a probe for total mass, we estimate mass-loss rates of
$\dot{M}\sim1\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in dust-forming outflows of red
ULXs. Based on the transient mid-IR behavior and its relatively flat spectral
index, $\alpha=-0.19\pm0.1$, we suggest that the mid-IR emission from Holmberg
IX X-1 originates from a variable jet.

<p class="mathjax">We analyze the highest-resolution millimeter continuum and near-infrared
(NIR) scattered-light images presented to date of the circumbinary disk
orbiting V4046 Sgr, a ~20 Myr old actively accreting, close binary T Tauri star
system located a mere 72.4 pc from Earth. We observed the disk with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 870-micron during Cycle 4, and
we analyze these data in conjunction with archival NIR (H band) polarimetric
images obtained with SPHERE/IRDIS on the ESO Very Large Telescope. At 0.3'' (20
au) resolution, the 870-micron image reveals a marginally resolved ring that
peaks at ~32 au and has an extension of ~ 90 au. We infer a lower limit on dust
mass of ~ 60.0 M_earth within the 870-micron ring, and confirm that the ring is
well aligned with the larger-scale gaseous disk. A second, inner dust ring is
also tentatively detected in the ALMA observations; its position appears
coincident with the inner (~14 au radius) ring detected in scattered light.
Using synthetic 870 micron and H-band images obtained from disk-planet
interaction simulations, we attempt to constrain the mass of the putative
planet orbiting at 20 au. Our trials suggest that a circumbinary Jovian-mass
planet may be responsible for generating the dust ring and gap structures
detected within the disk. We discuss the longevity of the gas-rich disk
orbiting V4046 Sgr in the context of the binary nature of the system.

<p class="mathjax">The rapid-neutron capture process ($r$ process) is identified as the producer
of about 50\% of elements heavier than iron. This process requires an
astrophysical environment with an extremely high neutron flux over a short
amount of time ($\sim$ seconds), creating very neutron-rich nuclei that are
subsequently transformed to stable nuclei via $\beta^-$ decay. One key
ingredient to large-scale $r$-process reaction networks is radiative
neutron-capture ($n,\gamma$) rates, for which there exist virtually no data for
extremely neutron-rich nuclei involved in the $r$ process. Due to the current
status of nuclear-reaction theory and our poor understanding of basic nuclear
properties such as level densities and average $\gamma$-decay strengths,
theoretically estimated ($n,\gamma$) rates may vary by orders of magnitude and
represent a major source of uncertainty in any nuclear-reaction network
calculation of $r$-process abundances. In this review, we discuss new
approaches to provide information on neutron-capture cross sections and
reaction rates relevant to the $r$ process. In particular, we focus on
indirect, experimental techniques to measure radiative neutron-capture rates.
While direct measurements are not available at present, but could possibly be
realized in the future, the indirect approaches present a first step towards
constraining neutron-capture rates of importance to the $r$ process.
